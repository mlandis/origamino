MODEL ENHANCEMENTS

	Selection Regimes:
		- omega^(k) where k > 1
		- physicochemical constraints -- should help avoid cysteine chains
			hydropathy
			polarity(G)
			polarity(Z)
			isoelectric point
			volume
		- secondary structure:
			free energy
			contact maps between secondary structures?
	
	Secondary Structure:
		- designate sections to secondary structures (a-helix, b-sheet, etc)
		- need to research on protein databank for feasibility

	Recombination:
		- allow segments of sequence to horizontally transfer
		- if a protein retains functionality despite recombination, then the recomb region may not have structural significance
		- allow segments outside the homologous regions to copy back & forth??

	Contact maps:
		- instead of constructing a contact map for amino acids w/in 4.5angstroms
		-      why not give all elements in the contact map a value proportional to inverse squares
		-      F = 1 / r^2
		- reference the contact map paper: RE: 9-12 angstrom distance for Van der Waals forces is optimal!!
	
	Conformation families:
		- sample from from varying conformation possibilities.
		- would molecular evolution have to allow all conformations to exist?
